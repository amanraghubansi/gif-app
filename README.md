GIFtâ€™ed : 

engineers search for the best GIFs around internetown by building GIFted. A fast, easy to use GIF app that runs on all modern browsers built using modern web technologies.
You're free to fancy React, Vue, Svelte or any other well-known web framework. If you prefer your web apps vanilla (JS) flavoured, well, we'll still judge! ðŸ˜‰
GIFted should let users:
* search GIFs via keyword(s)
*  show matching GIFs in a space optimized grid
* play/pause GIFs
Make sure:
* the app is fast & the UX like hot knife on butter
* the code is neat, structured well & is a breeze to read
* is responsive and accessible
Dazzle us:
* think of one awesomesauce feature of your own like infinite scrolling, make it a PWA, light/dark theme and run with it
